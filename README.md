# A3-FOB-Builder
Drop in FOB Building Scripts




Simply drop in all of the scripts into your main mission dir where the mission.sqm file is.
If you already have an initServer initLocalPlayer etc just copy whats inside these and paste them into yours.
Make sure the #include for the .hpp defines are at the top of your description.ext

Currently setup to take sandbags from either player inventory or nearby sandbag crates vn_b_ammobox_supply_10, vn_b_ammobox_06
Also has a check for if the player is an engineer or not if they are not they cannot build.

enjoy :)
